<h1>About Us</h1>

<div>
	This site is based on a modified version of OpenBooru as a way to make it easier to access other
	booru's content. It was inspired by r34.app, rule34.world as well as friendlyanon's userscripts.
	With this site there were three key features I wanted to have:
	<ul>
		<li>Multi-booru Support</li>
		<li>Improved Search</li>
		<li>Column and Fullscreen Navigation</li>
	</ul>
</div>
